**Digit Recognition Model using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

This project is a digit recognition system built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and can predict hand-drawn digits on a canvas implemented using Tkinter.

Features
A simple drawing interface where users can draw digits.
A pre-trained CNN model for recognizing digits.
Real-time prediction of digits based on user drawings.
